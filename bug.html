<p>This is a common error that arises when you use an HTML tag that is not supported by all browsers. For example, the <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code> tag is supported by modern browsers, but not by older browsers like Internet Explorer. When an older browser encounters an unsupported tag, it may simply ignore it or render it in a way that is not intended. This can lead to unexpected layout issues or even security vulnerabilities.  Another example is incorrect nesting of tags, especially self-closing tags.  For example, the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag, while often self-closing in practice, should ideally have a closing tag for better validation.  Incorrect nesting can lead to the browser not interpreting the HTML correctly.</p><p>Example of unsupported tag:</p><code>&lt;dialog open&gt;This is a dialog&lt;/dialog&gt;</code><p>Example of incorrect nesting (though functional in most browsers):</p><code>&lt;img src="image.jpg" /&gt;</code>
